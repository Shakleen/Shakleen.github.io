## Problem
* **Backend**: Needed fast, type-safe language — Python/JS too slow, Rust/C too complex.
* **Frontend**: Wanted single codebase for all platforms — React Native slow and not type-safe.

## Solution
* **Backend**: Chose Go for excellent performance and static typing.
* **Frontend**: Chose Flutter for native performance, type safety, and single codebase.

## Result
* **Backend**: ~50% higher requests/second than Python, no type-related bugs, faster development.
* **Frontend**: One codebase across platforms, better performance than React Native, saved significant time and code.
