## Problem
Studying drug induced migraines on mice required processing huge datasets (50GB+) of microscope recordings of brain vessels.

## Solution
1. Initially implemented image processing script leveraging digital image processing techniques like morphological transformation, Gaussian blur, unsharp filter, etc.
2. Automated above process using ResNET model to detect vascular structures and compute temporal diameter changes.

## Result
The automated pipeline achieved 93% accuracy on clean datasets, significantly accelerating the research timeline.
