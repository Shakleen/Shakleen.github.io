- **Targeted Knowledge Retention**: Engineered a recommendation system that fights knowledge decay by quizzing users on specific cards at their predicted point of forgetting.

- **Contextual Memory Reinforcement**: Implemented an intelligent "Adjacent Logic" that quizzes related card clusters to reinforce a user’s entire mental model of a topic.

- **Efficiency & Scalability**: Optimized the system architecture to handle 10x the traffic on the same compute footprint, significantly reducing cloud infrastructure costs.

- **Production Reliability**: Established a "Test-Driven Development" culture that achieved near-zero regression rates through rigorous automated integration and unit testing.
