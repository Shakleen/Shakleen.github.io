## Problem
Assessing media independence and bias traditionally requires manual, qualitative review which is subjective and slow to scale across global news outlets.

## Solution
I developed a machine learning pipeline that uses LLM Fine-Tuning (QLoRA) to classify news content and detect indicators of state control or editorial interference.

## Outcome
Created a scalable framework that provides objective, data-driven scores for press freedom, allowing for a comparative analysis of news outlets globally.
