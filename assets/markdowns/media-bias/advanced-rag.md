## Problem
Raw model outputs can lack context; understanding why a source is flagged as biased requires grounded evidence.

## Solution
Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide citations for classification decisions and applied rigorous statistical analysis to validate bias patterns.

## Result
Transformed unstructured news data into a structured intelligence platform, providing transparent and evidence-backed insights into media landscapes.
