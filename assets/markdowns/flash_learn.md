### Problem Statement

Learners forget content quickly; static review systems fail to adapt to individual knowledge decay.

### Details

- Designed and built an adaptive learning system that predicts content decay and dynamically quizzes users.

- Implemented RAG pipelines using open-source LLMs (**Gemma 3** via llama.cpp) to evaluate free-form answers and generate targeted feedback.

- Built backend services in Go, achieving **10×** performance improvement (lower CPU & memory utilization) over the initial Python implementation.

- **Flutter & WASM** $\to 20%$ faster load times

- **95%** test coverage for backend and **80%** for frontend
