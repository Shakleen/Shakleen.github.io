1. **Language Choice Impacts Bottom Line**: Transitioning from Python to Go demonstrated that choosing a language with superior concurrency can drastically reduce infrastructure costs.

2. **Semantic Search Over Keyword Match**: Implementing pgvector taught me that AI-driven semantic search is far more effective for educational remediation than exact-match querying.

3. **Testing is a Velocity Multiplier**: Enforcing a 90% test coverage rule showed that rigorous CI/CD actually accelerates development by eliminating the time-sink of manual regression testing.
